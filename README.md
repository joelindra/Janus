It provides a comprehensive suite of tools within a single PHP file, making it easy to deploy and manage.

## âœ¨ Features

Janus Shell is packed with features to provide complete control over a web server environment.

### **Core Interface**

  * **Modern UI:** A clean, dark-themed, and responsive single-page application (SPA) interface built for usability.
  * **Live Dashboard:** Get real-time statistics for CPU, RAM, and Disk usage.
  * **System Information:** Detailed information about the server OS, PHP version, user, IP addresses, and disabled PHP functions.
  * **Mobile Friendly:** The interface is fully responsive and usable on mobile devices.

### **File Management**

  * **AJAX-driven File Manager:** Browse directories, view file details, and navigate the filesystem without page reloads.
  * **Full CRUD Operations:** Create, Delete, Rename files and directories.
  * **Advanced File Editor:** An in-browser editor powered by **CodeMirror** with syntax highlighting for various languages.
  * **File Upload/Download:** Easily upload multiple files directly to the current directory or download files from the server.
  * **Mass Uploader:** Upload a single file to multiple selected directories at once using a directory tree browser.
  * **Permissions Management:** View permissions in both octal (`0755`) and symbolic (`drwxr-xr-x`) formats. Change file permissions directly.
  * **Archiving:** Create ZIP archives from files/directories and extract ZIP archives on the server.

  * **Network Information:** View network interface details (`ip addr`/`ifconfig`) and active connections (`netstat`).
  * **SUID/GUID Scanner:** A security auditing tool to find files with potentially exploitable SUID/GUID permissions for privilege escalation reconnaissance.
  * **Wget (Downloader):** Fetch files from any URL and save them directly to the server.

### **Stealth & Evasion**

  * **Base64 Communication:** All communication between the client and server is Base64 encoded to obscure traffic from basic inspection.
  * **Self-Destruct:** A one-click function to completely remove the shell script from the server.
